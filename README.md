# BIOC3301-
We used QIIME to analyse all our metadata. QIIME provided python scripts that analysed various aspects of the data. 
The scripts I chose and modified to analyse my data can be viewed in the gitignore file. 
The results of some scripts have not been mentioned in my report for the sake of being less relevant to my hypothesis than others.
