# BIOC3301-
We used QIIME to analyse all our metadata. QIIME provided python scripts that analysed various aspects of the data. 
The scripts I chose and modified to analyse my data can be viewed in the gitignore file. 
A summary of the purpose of each script is written above the script itself.
The results of some scripts have not been mentioned in my report for the sake of being less relevant to my hypothesis than others.
The figures I produced can also be viewed on GitHub. I have not included all of these in my report due to a lack of space.
I only included those that I believed were most relevant to my hypothesis or reflective of something explained in the text.
